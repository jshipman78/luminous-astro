// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What should we wear for our portrait session?",
    answer: "We recommend coordinating colors rather than matching outfits. Solid colors photograph best—avoid busy patterns, logos, and neon colors. Bring layers and accessories for variety. We're happy to provide wardrobe guidance during your consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where do you shoot portraits?",
    answer: "We offer both outdoor and studio sessions. For outdoor sessions, we know the best locations throughout Northeast Texas—parks, downtown areas, lakesides, and more. We can also come to your home or a meaningful location. Studio sessions are available by arrangement.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long is a typical portrait session?",
    answer: "Family and senior sessions typically run 1-2 hours, allowing time for multiple locations, outfit changes, and a variety of shots. Headshot sessions are usually 30-45 minutes. Mini sessions and special events vary.",
  },
  {
    question: "How soon will we receive our photos?",
    answer: "Your online gallery will be ready within 2 weeks of your session. Once you make your selections, final edited images are delivered within 1 week. Rush delivery is available if needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer prints and products?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer professional-quality prints, canvas wraps, albums, and other products through our print partner. While digital files are included in all sessions, there's something special about having printed portraits to display in your home.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if someone isn't feeling well or weather is bad?",
    answer: "Life happens! We offer one free reschedule for illness or severe weather. Just let us know as soon as possible so we can get you on the calendar for a new date.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you photograph large groups?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We regularly photograph extended families, corporate teams, and other large groups. For groups over 10 people, we recommend discussing logistics in advance to ensure we have adequate time and appropriate locations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you travel for portrait sessions?",
    answer: "We serve all of Northeast Texas and can travel for sessions within our service area at no additional charge. For destinations outside our area, we're happy to discuss travel arrangements.",
